# Vandermonde Matrices Analysis

This project computes the condition number of Vandermonde matrices in MATLAB to analyze conditioning and numerical stability.

It was developed as part of a university numerical analysis course assignment on matrix conditioning.

To run, execute the MATLAB code in R20XX or later. No other dependencies needed.

The algorithm generates Vandermonde matrices by varying the c parameter. It then calculates the reciprocal condition number using rcond().

The output displays the matrix details, condition number, and convergence analysis.

This demonstrates proficiency in mathematical programming, numerical analysis, and iterative computation.
